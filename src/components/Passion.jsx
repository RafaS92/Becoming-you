            <p>
              We’re a nationwide team of more than 600 fitness professionals
              with a wide range of backgrounds and experience. We love to hire
              the best people and match their unique expertise with our clients,
              whether it’s a science and research firm in Pennsylvania, a tech
              company in Seattle, or a retail corporation in North Carolina.
            </p>

            <p>
              We’ve since cultivated our fitness center management expertise
              through working with corporate clients of all sizes and
              industries. These experiences have powered us to stay ahead of
              trends, technologies and creative ways to offer unique service to
              our clients. And to us, success comes in the form of the deep
              relationships we’ve built with them along the way. In fact, we
              still work with Sprint – our first client we met more than 30
              years ago.
